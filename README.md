# Nexus Co-Op

Nexus Co-Op is a fork of Nucleus Co-Op (https://github.com/lucasassislar/nucleuscoop) that is modified to run on Linux-based systems.

# How does it work?
TBD but modeled after the process that Nucleus Co-Op uses. This allows (TBD) existing *.js files for Nucleus Co-Op to be used with Nexus Co-Op.

# How to help with development?
If you want to contribute code, do it directly to the Nucleus Co-Op project (https://github.com/lucasassislar/nucleuscoop) since there is no working build of Nexus Co-Op yet.
